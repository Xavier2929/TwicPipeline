This is not a must but here I'll add a dev diary on notes
that may help me further and some reflections throught the development of
this project.

always check the current branch 
with "git branch"

if I wanna move to another branch
use " git checkout branchname "

if I wanna add the changes to a new commit
"git add . "

if I wanna install/reinstall the libraries
mention on the requirements txt file run 
" pip install -r requirements.txt "
(run it when the venv is activated)
